## Featured README's

If you use this generator for one of your projects I would love to hear about it so I can feature it.

[[ readme.featured ]]

As inspiration for the layout of the generated README files I initially found inspiration from [terkelg's brilliant repository called prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts). I therefore want to mention him here even though he doesn't use this README library. If you want to see an example of a brilliant README file you should definitely check his repository out.
