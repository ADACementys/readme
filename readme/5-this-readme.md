## A bit about this readme

By now you are probably curious to know how this README file was generated? It was created from the following `blueprint.md` file.

```markdown
{{ template:logo }}
{{ template:title }}
{{ template:badges }}
{{ template:description }}
{{ readme.bullets }}
{{ template:toc }}
{{ load:readme/1-installation.md }}
{{ load:readme/2-create-blueprint.md }}
{{ load:readme/3-templates.md }}
{{ load:readme/4-load-markdown.md }}
{{ load:readme/5-this-readme.md }}
{{ load:readme/6-custom-templates.md }}
{{ load:readme/7-advanced.md }}
{{ load:readme/8-future-work.md }}
{{ template:contributors }}
{{ template:license }}
```

It really couldn't be more simple that this.
